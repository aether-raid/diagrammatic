# Diagrammatic

Diagrammatic is a powerful VSCode extension that automatically generates interactive visual representations of your codebase, helping you understand complex code structures at a glance.

Gain insights into unfamiliar code structures without spending hours reading documentation or tracing through files manually.

Diagrammatic is developed by a team of software engineers committed to making code comprehension easier. Our mission is to enhance software architecture understanding through intuitive visualization.
