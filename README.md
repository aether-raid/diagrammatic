## Development Installation Guide

* **Install dependencies**: npm install
* **Start in VSCode extension mode**: Press F5
  * This will run the environment in watch mode (both the Extension & the React webview)
  * Ensure your local .vscode folder is using the one in this repo.
  * **To start the extension**:
    * Ctrl+Shift+P > Diagrammatic: Show MVC Diagram
    * Might have more commands, all under diagrammatic
* <s>Start in browser: npm run dev</s> (not working after VScode integration, low-priority to fix)
